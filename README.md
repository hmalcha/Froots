# Froots
**Froots** is a python module to construct the root system
of the Feingold-Frenkel algebra to arbitrary height.

**Froots** is based on the
SimpLie program written by Teake Nutma, which is available at
https://github.com/teake/simplie. **Froots** extends the
scope of SimpLie by enableing the calculation of roots with
arbitrary height. This is achieved through the implementation
of custom classes for handling very large integers and
fractions.

## Usage
**Froots** requires a Python installation with 
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/). **Froots** is called with one
optional argument from the command line. The argument is the
heigh up to which the root system will be constructed.
If no argument is given, the calculation defaults to a height of 76.

The output is stored as a CSV file in the current directory.
The first three numbers in each row are the root vector and
the last number is the multiplicity of that root.

To run the package type

```
python -m froots [HEIGHT]
```
where [HEIGHT] is the optional argument. It can be either nothing or a 
positive integer.
